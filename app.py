        - **Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS)**: > 120 mg/dl indicates possible diabetes, increasing heart risk.
        - **Resting Electrocardiographic Results (Restecg)**: Measures heart's electrical activity.
          - 0: Normal
          - 1: ST-T wave abnormality (possible heart problem)
          - 2: Left ventricular hypertrophy (thickened heart muscle)
        - **Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (Thalach)**: Lower rates might indicate heart issues.
        - **Exercise Induced Angina (Exang)**: Chest pain triggered by exercise.
        - **ST Depression (Oldpeak)**: Indicates heart stress during exercise.
        - **Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (Slope)**:
          - 0: Upsloping — Better heart health.
          - 1: Flat — Higher risk.
          - 2: Downsloping — Potential heart disease.
        - **Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (CA)**: More blocked vessels indicate higher risk.
        - **Thalassemia (Thal)**:
          - 0: Normal blood flow.
          - 1: Fixed defect — Permanent damage.
          - 2: Reversible defect — Blood flow can improve.
